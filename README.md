## Convex Optimization
Useful convex optimization applications and algorithms.

- lp_solver
	- Implementation of an interior point method to solve simple LP problems with equality constraints.

- rational_function_fit
	- Solves a minimax rational function fit problem. Reformulating the problem as quasiconvex, the problem is solved by a bisection algorithm.

- spaceship_landing_trajectory
	- Perform trajectory optimization for a spaceship returning to Earth. Includes solutions to minimum fuel and minimum time descent problems.
