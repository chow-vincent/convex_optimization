## Convex Optimization
Useful convex optimization applications and algorithms.

- lp_solver
	- Implementation of interior point method to solve simple LP problems with equality constraints.

- rational_function_fit
	- Solves a minimax rational function fit problem. Reformulating the problem as quasiconvex, the problem is solved by a bisection algorithm.
