## Rational Function Fit

- rational_function_fit.ipynb
	- Demo fitting a rational function to data. Solves the minimax rational function fit problem by reformulating it as quasiconvex, and then solving by bisection.

- bisection_algorithm.py
	- Implementation to solve the quasiconvex problem mentioned above. Fits a 2nd degree rational function to data provided to the function.
